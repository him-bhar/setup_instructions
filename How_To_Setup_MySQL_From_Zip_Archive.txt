In Order to setup MySQL from a downloaded zip. Following things needs to be done.

Extract contents of the zip to a location.
e.g.
Extracted in > E:\database\MySQL
such that, bin folder is at> E:\database\MySQL\bin
Create an empty dir (for data) > E:\database\data

Create a basic options file to setup mysql  (contents below):

--START

[mysqld]
# set basedir to your installation path
basedir=E:/database/MySQL
# set datadir to the location of your data directory
datadir=E:/database/data

--END
Name this file as my.cnf and copy it in MySQL extracted location. E:\database\MySQL

When all this done, configuration wise we are done.

Now next steps:
1. Open command prompt with Admin privileges (as admin)
2. Goto bin dir (E:\database\MySQL\bin), and type -> mysqld.exe --initialize
This step will create tonnes of files in data directory (that we ourselves created in the starting and mentioned in my.cnf file.)
3. When step-2 is complete. In the data dir you will see a file name, <machine-name>.err , you will  see a message like.
2016-04-22T16:09:31.564944Z 1 [Note] A temporary password is generated for root@localhost: b4Zm1EQZE+!>
So this means mysql setup is done, and an account with username as 'root' and password as 'b4Zm1EQZE+!>' has been created and can be used to login from localhost.
4. Now in the same console, from bin dir run command. mysqld.exe --console, ideally the server should start.
5. Open another command prompt normal one this time. goto bin dir of mysql and run command.
mysql.exe -u root -p
This will prompt for a password, enter the password that mysql generated in step-3.
6. mysql prompt will open, execute command...  use mysql;  
This will fail with the following message. "ERROR 1820 (HY000): You must reset your password using ALTER USER statement before executing this statement."
To reset password run the following command.
mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<my_new_pass>';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
This will set the new password for the root user.

Now we are all ready to use mysql.
